####    This is simply a "clone" of instagram that i made for educational purposes.

**You can check the working app on:** [instaclone-Tnav-e](http://instaclonetnave.herokuapp.com/)
####    **The app:**

*   Please be patient with the app, the free tier heroku service is not the fastest one on the internet.
*   This app has email authentication, if you want to try it out without registering, you can use the following user:
*   email: admin@admin.com
*   password: 1234
*   PS: I couldn't find a free tier email service that didn't require a domain name, so I used one of my personal emails for this one, just don't spam  register too much, thank you.
*   
*   Feel free to use this code as you like.
*   
####    **Missing features:**
*   There's a few missing features but I'm not planning on improving this app, like I sayd this has been built for educational purposes only.
